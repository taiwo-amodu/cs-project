This project aims to help users locate the nearest emergency services (e.g., hospitals, police stations, fire stations) based on their current location. The system will use OSM data to provide real-time information about the closest emergency services, along with details like distance, travel time, and contact information.

Project Overview
The Emergency Service Locator will be a web-based application that allows users to:
1.	Find the nearest emergency services (hospitals, police stations, fire stations, etc.) based on their current location.
2.	Get directions to the selected service using the shortest or fastest route.
3.	View additional details about the service, such as contact information, operating hours, and user reviews.
4.	Report new emergency services or update existing ones in the database.

Modules Breakdown
1. ETL Module (Extract, Transform, Load)
•	Extract:
o	Use the OSM API or Overpass API to extract data about emergency services (e.g., hospitals, police stations, fire stations) in a specific area. The data will include details like name, location (latitude/longitude), address, and contact information.
•	Transform:
o	Clean and structure the extracted data. For example, you might want to calculate the distance between the user’s location and each emergency service.
o	Add additional metadata, such as travel time (using routing algorithms) or service type (e.g., general hospital, specialized clinic).
•	Load:
o	Load the transformed data into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. PostGIS will allow you to perform spatial queries, such as finding the nearest services based on the user’s location.
o	


2. CRUD Module (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
•	Create:
o	Allow users or administrators to add new emergency services to the database. For example, if a new hospital is built, it can be added manually.
•	Read:
o	Retrieve information about emergency services from the database. This will be used to display results to the user.
•	Update:
o	Allow users or administrators to update information about existing services. For example, if a hospital’s contact information changes, it can be updated in the database.
•	Delete:
o	Allow administrators to remove outdated or incorrect entries from the database.
3. API Module
•	A RESTful API that allows users to interact with the system. The API will provide endpoints for:
o	Finding nearest services: Given a user’s location (latitude/longitude), return the nearest emergency services.
	Example endpoint: GET /api/nearest-services?lat=51.5074&lon=-0.1278&radius=5000
o	Getting details: Return detailed information about a specific service.
	Example endpoint: GET /api/service-details?id=123
o	Adding/updating services: Allow authorized users to add or update services in the database.
	Example endpoint: POST /api/add-service
o	User reviews: Allow users to submit reviews or ratings for emergency services.
	Example endpoint: POST /api/add-review
o	Routing: Allow users to calculate their distance to the emergency services.

4. Technical Stack
•	Programming Language: Python 3
•	Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data handling
•	Libraries/Frameworks:
o	Flask or FastAPI for building the API
o	GeoPandas or Shapely for handling geospatial data
o	psycopg2 for interacting with PostgreSQL
o	Overpass API or OSMnx for extracting OSM data
•	Frontend (Optional): Adds-on
o	A web framework like React or Vue.js to build a user-friendly interface.
o	Integrating with a mapping library like Leaflet or Mapbox to display the results on a map.

Example Use Case
1.	A user is in an unfamiliar area and needs to find the nearest hospital.
2.	They open the Emergency Service Locator app and allow it to access their location.
3.	The app queries the database using the user’s coordinates and returns a list of nearby hospitals, sorted by distance.
4.	The user selects a hospital and views its details, including contact information and user reviews.
5.	The app provides directions to the hospital using the shortest route.
